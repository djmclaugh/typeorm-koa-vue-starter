# typeorm-koa-vue-starter
Boilerplate project for simple web app using sqlite as the databaes (through typeorm to easily migrate to other databases when needed), koa as the server, and vue as the front end framework.

Other tools I personally use (typescript, eslint, webpack, etc...) are also included and setup the way I like them.

Once I figure out how I want to structure my tests, I'll also add the test tooling in here.
